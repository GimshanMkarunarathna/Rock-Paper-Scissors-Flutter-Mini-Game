Rock Paper Scissors: A Flutter Mini-Game
Welcome to myFlutter project! This is a simple and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you can test your luck against a computer. I built this to practice the fundamentals of mobile development, specifically focusing on how to make an app react instantly to user choices.

The Experience

In this game, it’s you versus the machine. Once you pick your move—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—the computer makes a random choice in a split second. The winner is announced immediately, and the scoreboard updates in real-time. If the computer gets too far ahead, you can always hit the Reset button to wipe the slate clean and start a fresh match.

What Makes it Work

I designed the app to be as intuitive as possible. There are clear buttons for your moves and a dedicated Reset button for a fresh start. The layout is clean and centered, making it easy to play on any mobile screen. Behind the scenes, the computer’s moves are truly unpredictable thanks to built-in randomization logic.

Behind the Scenes

Building this was a fantastic way to learn the core building blocks of Flutter. I used a StatefulWidget to ensure the screen updates the moment a button is pressed, and I implemented the game rules using straightforward logic. By organizing the interface with Columns and Rows, I was able to keep the scoreboard and buttons perfectly aligned and professional-looking.

How to Run the Project

To get the game running on your own device, ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. First, clone this repository to your computer. Then, open your terminal in the project folder and run flutter pub get to download the dependencies. Finally, use the command flutter run to launch the game on your emulator or physical phone.
